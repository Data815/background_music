# Abstract
Music has gradually become an essential part of our lives, and it has become a common trend for most students to choose to listen to music while studying. This paper examines whether the background music affects students' attention level by conducting a within-subjects experiment to compare the time of finishing the Trail Making Test with and without music. From the liner mixed mode, the result shows that background music does not significantly impact attention level. Apart from that, male students tend to be more easily distracted by the background music.
